/***
 * [Expressions]
 * An expression is:
 *  The most basic building block of a program
 *  "a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation"
 *  Computes a value from a number of operands
 *  There is much, much more to expressions - not necessary at this level
 * 
 *  Expressions - examples
 *      34                      // literal
 *      favorite_number         // variable
 *      1.5 + 2.5               // addition
 *      2 * 5                   // multiplication
 *      a > b                   // relational
 *      a = b                   // assignment
 * 
 * [Statements]
 * A statement is:
 *      A complete line of code that performs some action
 *      Usually terminated with a semi-colon
 *      Usually contain expressions
 *      C++ has many types of statements
 *          expression, null, compound, selection, iteration, declaration, jump, try blocks, and others.
 * 
 * Example:
 *      int x;                                          // declaration
 *      favorite_number = 12;                           // assignment
 *      1.5 + 2.8;                                      // expression
 *      x = 2 * 5;                                      // assignment
 *      if (a > b) cout << "a is greater than b";       //if
 * 
 * [Using Operators]
 * C++ has a rich set of operators
 *      unary, binary, ternary
 * Common operators can be grouped as follows:
 *      assignment => modify the value of some object by assigning a new value to it
 *      arithmetic => perform mathematical operations on operands
 *      increment/decrement => part of them work like an assignment and part of them work like arithmetic
 *      relational => compare the values of two objects
 *      logical => test for logical or boolean conditions
 *      member access =>
 *      other
