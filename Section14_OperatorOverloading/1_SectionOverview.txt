 * Operator Overloading
 * 
 * What is Operator Overloading?
 * 
 * Overloading the assignment operator (=)      // It defines the semantics of what happens when assigned one object to another. C++ provides a default way of doing object assignment much as it did with the copy constructor.
 * //Example when use raw pointers in our classes, we must provide our own version of the assignment operator. 
 *  Copy semantics
 *  Move semantics
 * 
 * Overloading operators as member functions
 * 
 * Overloading operators as global functions
 * 
 * Overloading stream insertion (<<) and extraction operators (>>)
